Part 3: Short Exercises on the Shell

**Released: Friday, October 18**

For the third and last part of this homework,
we will complete a few tasks related to shell programming
and shell commands, particularly, with relevance to how
the shell is used in data science.

Please note:
The "project proposal" portion will be postponed to part of Homework 2.

===== Questions 1-5: Setup Scripting =====

1. For this first part, let's write a setup script
that downloads a dataset from the web,
clones a GitHub repository, and runs the Python script
contained in `script.py` on the dataset in question.

For the download portion, we have written a helper
download_file(url, filename) which downloads the file
at `url` and saves it in `filename`.

You should use Python subprocess to run all of these operations.

To test out your script, and as your answer to this part,
run the following:
    setup(
        "https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1/refs/heads/main/data/test-input.txt",
        "test-script.py"
    )

Then read the output of `output/test-output.txt`,
convert it to an integer and return it. You should get "12345".

"""

import subprocess
# You may need to conda install requests or pip3 install requests
import requests

def download_file(url, filename):
    r = requests.get(url)
    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(r.content)

def clone_repo(repo_url):
    """Clones the GitHub repository from the repo URL"""
    subprocess.run(f"git clone {repo_url}", shell=True, check=True)
    # raise NotImplementedError

def run_script(script_path, data_path):
    subprocess.run(f"python {script_path} {data_path}", shell = True, check=True)

def setup(repo_url, data_url, script_path):
    clone_repo(repo_url)
    download_file(data_url, "data.txt")
    run_script(script_path, "data.txt")

    with open("output/test-output.txt", "r", encoding = "utf-8") as f:
        return int(f.read().strip())

    

def q1():
    # Call setup as described in the prompt
    result = setup(
        "https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1/refs/heads/main/data/test-input.txt",
        "test-script.py"
    )

    return result

"""
2.
Suppose you are on a team of 5 data scientists working on
a project; every 2 weeks you need to re-run your scripts to
fetch the latest data and produce the latest analysis.

a. When might you need to use a script like setup() above in
this scenario?

=== ANSWER Q2a BELOW ===

=== END OF Q2a ANSWER ===

Do you see an alternative to using a script like setup()?

=== ANSWER Q2b BELOW ===

=== END OF Q2b ANSWER ===

3.
Now imagine we have to re-think our script to
work on a brand-new machine, without any software installed.
(For example, this would be the case if you need to run
your pipeline inside an Amazon cloud instance or inside a
Docker instance -- to be more specific you would need
to write something like a Dockerfile, see here:
https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/
which is basically a list of shell commands.)

Don't worry, we won't test your code for this part!
I just want to see that you are thinking about how
shell commands can be used for setup and configuration
necessary for data processing pipelines to work.

Think back to HW0. What sequence of commands did you
need to run?
Write a function setup_for_new_machine() that would
be able to run on a brand-new machine and set up
everything that you need.

Assume that you need your script to work on all of the packages
that we have used in HW1 (that is, any `import` statements
and any other software dependencies).

Assume that the new server machine is identical
in operating system and architecture to your own,
but it doesn't have any software installed.
It has Python 3.12
and conda or pip3 installed to get needed packages.

Hint: use subprocess again!

Hint: search for "import" in parts 1-3. Did you miss installing
any packages?
"""

def setup_for_new_machine():
    # TODO
    subprocess.run("pip install pandas")
    subprocess.run("pip install requests")
    subprocess.run("pip install numpy")
    result = setup(
        "https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavisPL-Teaching/119-hw1/refs/heads/main/data/test-input.txt",
        "test-script.py"
    )


def q3():
    # As your answer, return a string containing
    # the operating system name that you assumed the
    # new machine to have.
    # TODO
    os = "Linux"
    return os

"""
4. This question is open ended :)
It won't be graded for correctness.

What percentage of the time do you think real data scientists
working in larger-scale projects in industry have to write
scripts like setup() and setup_for_new_machine()
in their day-to-day jobs?

=== ANSWER Q4 BELOW ===

I feel like they would have to write these kinds of scripts 
10% of the time day to day. 

=== END OF Q4 ANSWER ===

5. Extra credit

Copy your setup_for_new_machine() function from Q3
(remove the other code in this file)
to a new script and run it on a friend's machine who
is not in this class. Did it work? What problems did you run into?

Only answer this if you actually did the above.
Paste the output you got when running the script on the
new machine:

===== Questions 6-9: A comparison of shell vs. Python =====

The shell can also be used to process data.

This series of questions will be in the same style as part 2.
Let's import the part2 module:
"""

import part2
import pandas as pd

"""
Write two versions of a script that takes in the population.csv
file and produces as output the number of rows in the file.
The first version should use shell commands and the second
should use Pandas.

For technical reasons, you will need to use
os.popen instead of subprocess.run for the shell version.
Example:
    os.popen("echo hello").read()

Runs the command `echo hello` and returns the output as a string.

Hints:
    1. Given a file, you can print it out using
        cat filename

    2. Given a shell command, you can use the `tail` command
        to skip the first line of the output. Like this:

    (shell command that spits output) | tail -n +2

    Note: if you are curious why +2 is required here instead
        of +1, that is an odd quirk of the tail command.
        See here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/604871/2038713

    3. Given a shell command, you can use the `wc` command
        to count the number of lines in the output

   (shell command that spits output) | wc -l
"""

import os

def pipeline_shell():
    # TODO
    line_count = os.popen("cat data/population.csv | tail -n +1 | wc -l").read()
    return line_count

def pipeline_pandas():
    pop_df = pd.read_csv("data/population.csv")
    return pop_df["Entity"].count()

def q6():
    # As your answer to this part, check that both
    # integers are the same and return one of them.
    # print("\n\n")
    # print(type(pipeline_pandas()))
    # print(pipeline_shell())
    # print("\n\n")
    assert int(pipeline_pandas()) == int(pipeline_shell())

    return pipeline_shell()
    # raise NotImplementedError

"""
Let's do a performance comparison between the two methods.

This time, no need to generate a plot.
Just use your ThroughputHelper and LatencyHelper classes
from part 2 to get answers for both pipelines.

7. Throughput
"""
from part2 import LatencyHelper, ThroughputHelper

def q7():
    # Return a tuple of two floats
    # throughput for shell, throughput for pandas
    # (in rows per second)

    h = ThroughputHelper()
    h.add_pipeline("shell", 59177, lambda: pipeline_shell())
    h.add_pipeline("pandas", 59177, lambda: pipeline_pandas())
    throughputs = h.compare_throughput()
    h.generate_plot("output/q7_chart.png")

    return tuple(throughputs)


"""
8. Latency
"""

def q8():
    # Return a tuple of two floats
    # latency for shell, latency for pandas
    # (in milliseconds)

    h = LatencyHelper()
    h.add_pipeline("shell", lambda: pipeline_shell())
    h.add_pipeline("pandas", lambda: pipeline_pandas())
    lats = h.compare_latency()
    h.generate_plot("output/q8_chart.png")

    return tuple(lats)

"""
9. Which method is faster?
Comment on anything else you notice below.

=== ANSWER Q9 BELOW ===

The throughput of the pandas is much better but 
the latency of shell is much better.
